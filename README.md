Our project aims to address the following key problems within the chosen theme:

1. Lack of Timely Alerts: Current disaster management systems often have delays in alerting the affected population. Our solution focuses on providing real-time alerts to improve response time.

2. Inadequate Information on Safe Points: People struggle to find reliable information about safe points during emergencies. We aim to create a comprehensive database and visualization of safe points for better decision-making.

3. Limited Data Visualization: Existing systems lack effective data visualization tools, making it challenging to understand the scope and impact of disasters. Our project includes robust data visualization features to enhance situational awareness.
